# Travelgroupie

Travelgroupie is an application used to search for your favorite artist's events. Once you have found the show that you would like to attend, restuarant recommendations and a flight search widget allows you to look at other activites in the city where the event takes place. You can sign up/sign in to the app and save your searches by clicking the star under a show that you have found. This will save for when you return to the site. The site also has a dark/light theme that can be toggled.

# Key Technologies Used

This application is using Googles firebase for session authentication, ticketmaster, yelp, and skyscanner API's. Dark and light theme is using local storage for persistence. It also uses URL query params for the search engine functionality.
